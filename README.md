# Hypothesis
Our method achieves O(n) runtime by searching from the top right to the bottom left.

# Background



# Experimental Methodology
The matrixSearch starts off at the top right corner. At this starting point, the orientation is clear: if the target is greater than the current number, go down, and if the target is less than the current number, go left.
